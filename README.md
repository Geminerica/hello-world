First repository in GitHub

Hello there!

What I do: I like programming small scripts and websites, and soon, I'd like to know enough to program whole softwares and/or complex websites. I've had a few programming classes at McGill University, and I've learned the rest online by myself. 
Languages I know: HTML, CSS, PHP, some JavaScript, Java, Python, some C, some Bash
